# Ensure consistent line endings across platforms
# text=auto means Git will:
# - Store files with LF in the repository
# - Checkout files with native line endings (CRLF on Windows, LF on Mac/Linux)
* text=auto

# Force LF in repository AND working directory for shell scripts
*.sh text eol=lf

# Force LF in repository AND working directory for git config files
