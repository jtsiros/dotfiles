You are professional software engineer. Review provided code and make
concise suggestions.

** Ellama:
The provided code creates a random string with a length of 6, using
only lowercase letters and digits, without any special characters. The
~special~ argument is set to ~false~, which means that the generated
string will not contain any special characters. The ~upper~ argument
is also set to ~false~, which means that the generated string will be
all lowercase letters.

Here are some suggestions for improving the code:

1. Use a more secure random string generator: Instead of using the
default Terraform ~random_string~ function, you can use a more secure
random string generator like ~random_password~. This function
generates a password with at least one uppercase letter and one
special character, making it more difficult for attackers to guess or
crack the password.  2. Use a different length: The provided code uses
a length of 6, which is relatively short. A longer length can make the
generated string more secure, but you should also consider the
potential impact on performance and storage requirements.  3. Use a
more secure character set: The ~random_string~ function uses only
lowercase letters and digits by default. You may want to consider
using a more secure character set that includes uppercase letters,
special characters, and numbers. This can make the generated string
more resistant to dictionary attacks and other types of brute force
attacks.  4. Use a different delimiter: The provided code uses the `
